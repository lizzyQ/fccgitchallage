Working through free code camp back end projects. 
Neither understanding code nor writing code slow me down. 
But this glitch thing which was suppose to be easier to use set me back for a week. 
I cann't export it even thought I already evoke the permission. 
Tried login/off my account, re-evoke the permission, switch to a new repo with files and without one, 
It's just not working.
So push it to git manully, which is way more easier then the 'export' button.
Why can't we just set up everything in computer locally then push it to git like any normal person would do?
Why do you want me to make a new repo for a new challenge.... Each challenge was like 5 line of code!!

Enough complaining. and let's keep working
